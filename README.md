1. Start a local http server using 
[http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) 

```
npx http-server ./ -p 8080 --cors -c-1
```
2. Pick your public IP Adress and use that in the widget or if you want to send it for someone else then you can use use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to proxy your server 

Note: check your browser log if it's not blocking file because it's not server over https
